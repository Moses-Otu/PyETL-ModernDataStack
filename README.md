## Overview

This project aims to extract football league standings and match scores from various leagues using web scraping techniques. The extracted data is then analyzed to derive insights and answer important business questions related to team performance, league dynamics, and trends in the football landscape.

## Project Components

1. **Web Scraping:** The project utilizes Python's `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries to scrape data from multiple URLs containing league standings and match scores.

2. **Data Transformation:** Extracted data is transformed into structured DataFrames using the Pandas library. Data cleaning and formatting are performed to ensure consistency and usability.

3. **AWS Integration:** Extracted and transformed data is loaded into an AWS S3 bucket, providing secure cloud storage for further analysis.

4. **Data Analysis:** Insights are derived from the data using Pandas operations and visualization libraries. Business questions are answered based on league standings and match scores.

5. **GitHub Repo:** This GitHub repository contains the code, data, and documentation for the entire project.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- BeautifulSoup library
- AWS account for S3 integration

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `scrape_league_data.py` script to extract league standings.
4. Run the `scrape_match_scores.py` script to extract match scores.
5. Data transformation, analysis, and visualization can be performed using the Jupyter Notebook provided.

## Project Insights

This project provides insights into team performance, league standings, and match scores across multiple football leagues. By analyzing the extracted data, we can answer questions about team rankings, trends, and correlations between league standings and match outcomes.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement predictive analytics to forecast team performance.
- Create interactive dashboards to visualize insights in real-time.
- Explore machine learning models for outcome prediction.
